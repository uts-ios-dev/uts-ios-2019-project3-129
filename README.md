# BlogChain

BlogChain is a blog platform running on iOS which hosts its blogs on the blockchain. By doing so, it is easier to protect the intellectual property and may extend the lifehood of articles (as long as one copy exists in the network).

## Frameworks
### Storage
The implementation of the blockchain is based on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) (InterPlanetary File System), which is backed by Ethereum.

### Query

For now, we use [Oraclize](https://docs.oraclize.it/#security-deep-dive) to get our data on IPFS.

### Search
Because of the speciality of the back-end, we are considering implementing our search engine by [Lens](https://github.com/RTradeLtd/Lens).
